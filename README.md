# CodingProject
This project includes a set of functions implemented specialy to analyze neural activity using information theory techniques.
Most of the functions included here are reffered to the proccess of computing information, extraction more interesting and
informative sets of data and plotting them.
There is a group of functions for loading data and pre-processing it that would be included in another repository.

All of this code has been used to the publication of: Information-Theoretical Analysis of the Neural Code in the Rodent Temporal Lobe. Entropy 2018
